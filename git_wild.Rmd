## Part A: Make edits (no conflict)

```{r partner_1a}
# Partner 1: 
# Run the code below to see the original graph
# Change the code below to make the point color change based on 'cut', and update the theme to theme_bw(). Update the title to include your first name. 

ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cut)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Leonardo was here")
```

```{r partner_2a}
# Partner 2: 
# Run the code below to see the original graph
# Change the code below to make the geom a geom_jitter, and update the theme to theme_light. Update the title to include your first name. 

ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = color, y = carat)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Kat was here")
  
```

## PART B: Make problems

```{r break-it-1}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = table, y = price)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_dark() +
  labs(title = "kat graph")
```

```{r break-it-2}
diamonds_carat <- diamonds %>% 
  select(carat, cut, depth, color)
ggplot(diamonds_carat, aes(x = cut, y = depth)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "cyan4") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())
```
